Absolutely! Referring to your script that splits audio into chunks based on silence as "splitr" is a great way to keep things organized. Below, I've made some adjustments to include a setup for the script named `splitr.py`. This script takes an input file, processes it starting from a specified time, and splits it into chunks with a minimum length of 15 minutes, ensuring it only splits at silent parts.

### Setup for `splitr.py`

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment
from pydub.silence import split_on_silence

def get_milliseconds(hms_time):
    """ Convert time in 'hh:mm:ss' format to milliseconds """
    h, m, s = map(int, hms_time.split(':'))
    return ((h * 3600) + (m * 60) + s) * 1000

def combine_chunks(chunks, min_length_ms):
    """ Combine smaller chunks into chunks of at least the minimum length """
    combined = []
    current_chunk = chunks[0]
    for chunk in chunks[1:]:
        if len(current_chunk) < min_length_ms:
            current_chunk += chunk
        else:
            combined.append(current_chunk)
            current_chunk = chunk
    if len(current_chunk) >= min_length_ms:  # Make sure the last chunk meets the minimum length
        combined.append(current_chunk)
    return combined

def split_audio(file_path, start_time):
    """ Split audio file based on silence """
    # Load the lecture file
    lecture = AudioSegment.from_file(file_path)

    # Convert start time to milliseconds and slice the audio
    start_time_ms = get_milliseconds(start_time)
    lecture_from_start = lecture[start_time_ms:]

    # Split on silence, adjust silence_thresh and silence duration as needed
    chunks = split_on_silence(
        lecture_from_start,
        min_silence_len=500,  # in ms
        silence_thresh=-40   # in dB
    )

    # Minimum length for each chunk (15 minutes)
    min_length_ms = 15 * 60 * 1000

    # Combine chunks to meet the minimum length requirement
    combined_chunks = combine_chunks(chunks, min_length_ms)

    # Save each chunk
    for i, chunk in enumerate(combined_chunks):
        out_file = f"chunk{i}.mp3"
        chunk.export(out_file, format="mp3")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    if len(sys.argv) < 3:
        print("Usage: python splitr.py <file_path> <start_time>")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    file_path = sys.argv[1]
    start_time = sys.argv[2]
    split_audio(file_path, start_time)
```

### How to Use `splitr.py`

1. **Ensure all prerequisites are installed**: Make sure Python, PyDub, and FFmpeg are installed in your environment.
2. **Prepare your audio file**: Place your `.mp3` or other audio file in an accessible directory.
3. **Run the script**:
    - Open your command line interface.
    - Navigate to the directory containing `splitr.py`.
    - Execute the script by typing:
      ```
      python splitr.py path_to_your_file.mp3 hh:mm:ss
      ```
      Replace `path_to_your_file.mp3` with the path to your audio file and `hh:mm:ss` with the starting time from which you want to begin processing the audio.

This setup should make `splitr` a robust tool for splitting audio files as per your requirements, and it should handle larger files effectively by ensuring each segment is at least 15 minutes long and starts only at silence.
