### How to Use `splitr.py`

1. **Ensure all prerequisites are installed**: Make sure Python, PyDub, and FFmpeg are installed in your environment.
2. **Prepare your audio file**: Place your `.mp3` or other audio file in an accessible directory.
3. **Run the script**:
    - Open your command line interface.
    - Navigate to the directory containing `splitr.py`.
    - Execute the script by typing:
      ```
      python splitr.py path_to_your_file.mp3 hh:mm:ss
      ```
      Replace `path_to_your_file.mp3` with the path to your audio file and `hh:mm:ss` with the starting time from which you want to begin processing the audio.

This setup should make `splitr` a robust tool for splitting audio files as per your requirements, and it should handle larger files effectively by ensuring each segment is at least 15 minutes long and starts only at silence.
